# Bridgey Protocol v1

Status: draft. This document is normative for wire interoperability. JSON is
UTF-8 encoded. Implementations must ignore unknown object fields but reject
unknown major envelope versions.

## Discovery

Browse and publish DNS-SD service type `_bridgey._tcp.local.`. TXT values are
UTF-8 and advisory:

| Key | Meaning | Limit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | Stable random UUID, used only as a hint before authentication | 36 bytes |
| `name` | User-visible device name | 64 bytes |
| `version` | Highest supported envelope major version | 8 bytes |
| `platform` | `android`, `macos`, or a future identifier | 16 bytes |

The SRV port identifies the TLS WebSocket listener. TXT, hostnames, addresses,
and ports are attacker-controlled until the peer authenticates. Implementations
must deduplicate discoveries by service instance and refresh endpoints on every
network change.

## Framing and envelope

After the TLS WebSocket opens, each text frame contains exactly one JSON object:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "id": "018f5228-76c7-7b37-a42c-3cfe6f78219a",
  "type": "clipboard.update",
  "timestamp": 1786550000000,
  "replyTo": null,
  "expectsReply": false,
  "payload": {}
}
```

`id` is unique per sender (UUIDv7 recommended). `timestamp` is Unix epoch
milliseconds and is used for diagnostics/expiry, not message ordering. `replyTo`
correlates a response or acknowledgement. Receivers keep a bounded, persistent
window of recently accepted IDs per peer; a repeated ID is acknowledged if
needed but its side effect is not executed again.

Limits before negotiation for the planned capability envelope are 256 KiB per
JSON frame, depth 32, string length 128 KiB, and 1,024 keys. The current native
newline transport intentionally applies a stricter 65,536-byte frame limit
before UTF-8/JSON decoding. A malformed, oversized, or unterminated frame closes
the session before plugin dispatch. File chunks remain bounded independently.

## Session negotiation

The first authenticated application message is `core.hello`:

```json
{
  "deviceId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "deviceName": "Semyon's MacBook Pro",
  "platform": "macos",
  "protocolVersions": [1],
  "capabilities": ["battery.send.v1", "clipboard.v1", "files.v1", "notifications.receive.v1"]
}
```

The selected version is the highest intersection. Capability negotiation is the
set intersection; absence means disabled. Device ID must match the identity
bound to the pinned key. No common version closes the connection with
`unsupported_version`.

Core types are `core.hello`, `core.ack`, `core.error`, `core.ping`, and
`core.pong`. An acknowledgement payload contains `status` (`accepted`,
`completed`, or `rejected`). Errors contain a stable `code`, safe `message`, and
optional details. Error text must not disclose secrets.

The current native clients also exchange an authenticated, encrypted
`features.update` message after pairing and whenever local policy changes. Its
version 1 payload contains a complete boolean map for `clipboard`, `files`,
`notifications`, `battery`, and `find_device`. A UI action is available only
when both peers report the corresponding feature as enabled. Clients predating
this message are treated as enabling all known v1 features for compatibility.

## Pairing flow

Pairing runs only after a user selects a discovered peer:

1. Both peers create ephemeral P-256 ECDH key pairs and exchange
   `pairing.offer`/`pairing.answer` containing nonces and public keys.
2. Each validates all fields and derives the same secret with platform crypto.
3. HKDF-SHA-256 derives independent verification and session keys, binding the
   ordered public keys, nonces, device IDs, and protocol version into `info`.
4. A six-digit code derived from the verification key is displayed on both
   devices. It is never sent over the network.
5. Each user explicitly confirms; peers exchange authenticated
   `pairing.confirm` records containing their long-term public keys.
6. Trust is stored only after both confirmations verify. Any timeout, mismatch,
   rejection, or disconnect erases ephemeral state.

Pairing offers expire after two minutes and cannot be silently retried. The
short code is a human MITM check, not a password. Detailed primitive and storage
requirements are in `SECURITY.md`.

## Plugin messages

### Battery (`battery.send.v1`)

Android sends `battery.update` after a secure session is established and when
the system reports a battery-state change:

```json
{
  "level": 79,
  "isCharging": true
}
```

`level` is an integer from 0 through 100. Receivers reject out-of-range or
malformed values. Battery updates contain no device identifier because the
authenticated session already binds them to the paired sender.

### Clipboard (`clipboard.v1`)

`clipboard.update` remains the compatible plain-text form: its decrypted payload
is UTF-8 text. `clipboard.rich` carries versioned UTF-8 JSON:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "text": "example",
  "html": "<p><strong>example</strong></p>"
}
```

The combined text and HTML content is limited to 32 KiB before encryption. The
text field is mandatory and is always written as a fallback; supported clients
also write the HTML representation. Receivers reject malformed, unsupported,
empty, or oversized payloads. Each encrypted update has a unique message ID and
the current transport replies with `clipboard.ack` after the write. If local
policy disabled clipboard handling while a peer still had stale capability
state, it replies with `clipboard.rejected` and immediately resends the
encrypted `features.update`; senders time out rather than displaying an
unbounded sending state.

### Files (`files.v1`)

`files.offer` carries transfer ID, display filename, MIME type, unsigned byte
size, and SHA-256. `files.accept` selects a binary stream; `files.progress` is
advisory; `files.cancel` is idempotent; `files.complete` confirms the final hash.
Paths from a sender are never accepted. Implementations stream through bounded
buffers, enforce negotiated size limits, and delete or clearly mark partials.

The current JSON transport streams encrypted 24 KiB chunks rather than a raw
binary substream. An encrypted `files.offer` contains `transferId`, `name`,
`mimeType`, `size`, and the base64-encoded SHA-256. After `files.accept`, each
`files.chunk` carries the transfer ID, a monotonically increasing sequence
number, and an independently AES-GCM-encrypted chunk. An encrypted
`files.complete` repeats the transfer ID and hash; the receiver replies with
`files.complete.ack` only after byte count and hash verification and the atomic
rename of the partial file. The macOS v1 receiver saves collision-safe names in
a user-selected directory (default `~/Downloads/Bridgey`) and removes partial
files when a transfer is interrupted.

Version 1 does not resume a partial file stream. If a connection is interrupted,
the receiver deletes its pending partial file and both clients mark the transfer
as interrupted. A user-initiated retry creates a new transfer identifier,
recomputes the digest, and sends the file again from byte zero.

The Android v1 receiver writes through `MediaStore` to `Download/Bridgey` with
`IS_PENDING` set until verification, so partial files are hidden and deleted on
failure without requiring broad storage access.
Either peer can send `files.cancel` with the transfer ID. The sender stops
reading and sending chunks, while the receiver closes and deletes its partial
file. Cancellation is idempotent and leaves the authenticated session usable.
For Mac-to-Android transfers, Android sends cumulative `files.chunk.ack`
messages and macOS keeps at most 64 chunks (1.5 MiB) unacknowledged. This bounds
memory and cancellation latency without limiting throughput to one network
round trip per chunk.
An offer repeats its transfer ID in the outer session message so a receiver
whose local file policy is disabled can return `files.rejected` without
decrypting or accepting the offer. It then resends `features.update` to repair
stale UI state on the sender.

### Notifications (`notifications.send.v1`, `notifications.dismiss.v1`)

`notifications.post` carries package, application name, opaque notification ID,
title, text, timestamp, and an optional size-bounded icon reference. Content is
sensitive and must not be logged. `source=bridgey` messages are never forwarded.
`notifications.dismiss` carries the opaque notification ID back to Android when
the user dismisses its mirrored macOS notification. `notifications.remove`
carries the same ID to macOS when the original notification disappears on
Android. Both reference payloads are encrypted, replay-protected, limited to a
512-character opaque ID, and valid only for the authenticated device session.
Clients that do not recognize these messages ignore them. Future
`notification-actions.v1` messages reference the same opaque ID and a separately
scoped, 64-character action token. A `notifications.post` may contain up to four
actions with a 64-character title and `allowsReply` flag. macOS returns
`notifications.action` with the notification ID, action token, and an optional
reply of at most 4,096 characters. Android executes only tokens retained for the
still-active source notification; arbitrary `PendingIntent` data never crosses
the transport.

In the current JSON transport, the notification payload is AES-GCM encrypted
and contains `packageName`, `applicationName`, `notificationId`, `title`, `text`,
and the Android post time in Unix milliseconds. Android excludes Bridgey's own
foreground notification, ongoing items, group summaries, secret notifications,
and empty content before encryption.

### Find device (`find-device.v1`)

Either connected peer can send an encrypted `find.start` payload containing an
opaque `alertId`. The receiver plays a repeating local alert until either user
stops it. An encrypted `find.stop` with the same logical alert scope stops the
local sound. The receiver answers with encrypted `find.started` or
`find.stopped`, and only that acknowledgement changes the sender's displayed
state. All messages use unique message IDs and are accepted only inside an
authenticated paired session.

Android presents a separate ongoing find-device notification with a Stop
action while its alert is active. Stopping from that action, from either app,
or disconnecting stops the local alert; find-device state is never persisted
across sessions.

## Compatibility

Adding optional fields or message types is backward compatible. Changing field
meaning, authentication, or required behavior requires a new capability or
major version. JSON is a codec behind the envelope model; a future protobuf
codec must preserve IDs, types, correlation, and negotiated semantics.
